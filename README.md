## Description
    This application generates a password for the user if they click the corresponding button, and the password is displayed in the window.

## Function
    If the user clicks on the corresponding button, they are then asked to confirm if they want uppercase, special, or numeric characters respectively in their password. Depending on the user's choices, a password is generated with a random number of characters, those characters being chosen randomly from the arrays that correspond with the user's choices. The password, which is an array, is then shuffled to randomize it before being displayed in the window.
